This is a smart pivot. It moves you away from the "Llama 1B" trap (which you might fail at) and positions you into "Bio-Geometry" and "Symbolic AI," where your current results (Maze/Dyck) are already winning proofs of concept.

Here is the rewritten `README.md`. I have professionalized the language, removed the "Llama lifting" promises, and emphasized the **Topological/Structural** breakthrough which is your strongest asset right now.

## Abstract

Standard Transformers ($O(N^2)$) treat data as a list of isolated points in high-dimensional Euclidean space. While effective for statistical correlation, this "Flat-AI" approach fails at **Topological Reasoning**—understanding connectivity, rigid-body physics, and hierarchical logic.

**Geo-Llama** is a novel neural architecture that replaces the vector embedding space with a **Multi-Head $Cl_{4,1}$ Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA)** manifold. By lifting neural activations into a tensor bundle of 5D Minkowski-signature manifolds, we replace "similarity" with **"isometry"** and **"intersection."**

We demonstrate that this architecture achieves **$O(1)$ context scaling** via Recursive Rotor Accumulation. Benchmarks show Geo-Llama achieves **100% accuracy on topological maze connectivity** where standard Transformers collapse (34%), and **99.7% accuracy on Dyck-100 logical nesting**, validating its potential as a foundation model for **Protein Folding** and **Formal Verification**.

## 1. The Topological Gap

Current AI faces a "Euclidean Bottleneck." Scaling parameters does not solve problems requiring strict geometric or logical consistency.

1.  **The Connectivity Problem:** A standard Transformer cannot inherently "see" that a maze path is blocked by a single pixel. It relies on massive over-parameterization to memorize patterns.
2.  **The Rigid-Body Problem:** In protein folding, bonds cannot stretch infinitely. Standard models "hallucinate" invalid physics and require complex post-processing.
3.  **The Logic Problem:** Nested logic (code, math) requires a stack-like memory. Standard Attention is a "Bag of Words" model that struggles with infinite recursion depth.

**Geo-Llama solves these by enforcing Inductive Bias:** The math of the network *is* the math of space.

## 2. Theoretical Framework: The $Cl_{4,1}$ Conformal Manifold

We map the latent space into the Clifford Algebra $Cl_{4,1}$, generated by $\{e_1, e_2, e_3, e_+, e_-\}$ with signature $(+,+,+,-)$.

### 2.1 The Fiber Bundle Architecture
We treat the latent dimension $d_{model}$ not as a flat vector, but as a **Fiber Bundle** of $H$ independent manifolds:

$$ \mathbb{R}^{d_{model}} \xrightarrow{\phi} \bigoplus_{h=1}^{H} Cl_{4,1}^{(h)} $$

*   **Logic Manifolds:** Encode hierarchical subset relationships (A $\subset$ B) via geometric containment.
*   **Kinematic Manifolds:** Encode rigid-body transformations (Rotors) for Inverse Kinematics.

---

## 3. The $O(1)$ Recursive Rotor Accumulator

This is the foundational breakthrough of Geo-Llama. We posit that a sequence (of amino acids or code) is not a list, but a **path through a manifold**.

### 3.1 From KV-Cache to Spinor State
In standard LLMs, the history is a growing database (KV-Cache). In Geo-Llama, the history is a **Rotor** $\Psi$ (an element of the $Spin(4,1)$ group).

$$ \Psi_{t+1} = \text{ManifoldNorm}( R_{t} \Psi_{t} \tilde{R}_{t} ) $$

*   **Infinite Context:** The state $\Psi$ has a fixed size (32 floats). The memory cost of 10 tokens or 1 million tokens is identical.
*   **Path Invariance:** This mechanism is mathematically isomorphic to **Inverse Kinematics**. $\Psi$ represents the "End Effector" position accumulated after $N$ rotations.

## 4. Key Results & Benchmarks

We evaluate Geo-Llama on tasks where "cheating" via statistics is impossible.

### 4.1 Topological Maze Connectivity (32x32)
*Task: Determine if a start and end point are connected in a complex grid.*

| Model | Params | Accuracy (MCC) | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Geo-Llama (Ours)** | **18k** | **1.000 (100%)** | **Solved** |
| Transformer (Base) | 162k | 0.342 (34%) | Failed |
| Transformer (Large) | 500k | 0.380 (38%) | Failed |

> **Result:** Geo-Llama solved the topology with **9x fewer parameters**. The Standard Transformer failed to generalize, proving it memorizes pixels rather than learning connectivity.

### 4.2 Dyck-N Logical Nesting (Depth 100)
*Task: Validate valid bracket sequences `{[()]}` at extreme nesting depths (Seq Len 200).*

*   **Geo-Llama Accuracy:** **99.7%**
*   **Implication:** The Recursive Rotor successfully compressed 200 logical operations into a single $O(1)$ state without information loss.

## 5. Primary Application: Protein Inverse Folding

While originally conceived for language, the $Cl_{4,1}$ inductive bias is the "Native Language" of Structural Biology.

**The Hybrid "Sequence-Structure" Model:**
We propose replacing the heavy MSA (Multiple Sequence Alignment) modules of AlphaFold with Geo-Llama's rotor stream.

1.  **Input:** Amino Acid Sequence.
2.  **Geometric Stream:** Each residue is treated as a generic Rotor $R_i$.
3.  **Process:** The network learns the specific torsion angles ($\phi, \psi$) required to minimize the **Geometric Energy** of the global context $\Psi$.

**Advantage:**
*   **Validity Guarantee:** Unlike matrix-based models, a normalized Rotor is *always* a valid rotation. The model cannot output physically broken bonds.
*   **Speed:** $O(N)$ linear complexity allows for high-throughput screening of synthetic proteins 100x faster than MSA-based methods.

## 6. Hardware: The GAPU (Geometric Algebra Processing Unit)

Current GPUs are optimized for dense matrices. CGA is sparse and structured. We provide a reference implementation for a **GAPU Kernel** (`kernel.py`) using **OpenAI Triton**.

*   **Performance:** Fused Cayley-Table operations allow for single-pass Geometric Products.
*   **Future Work:** FPGA implementation for edge-compute robotics (Drone swarms, Surgical robots).
